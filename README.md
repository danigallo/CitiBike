# Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the scripts I used to analyze how several different factors of Citi Bike

1. accessibility - who has access to citi bike? 
2. ebike_analysis - what bikes are e-bikes and how are these being used differently than regular bikes?
3. station_network - how has movement between neighborhoods changed since the introduction of e-bikes?

## Dependencies
* Code is written in Python 3
* Some notebooks reference "tripdata_2018.csv" and "tripdata_2017.csv" - these are not included in the repository because they were to heavy. This data can be found via [Citi Bike's Trip Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html)
